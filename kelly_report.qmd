## Introduction

This project, started by a faculty colleague in urban studies, has a data dump from Travis Central Appraisal District (TCAD) on Austin property valuations in 1990 that exported around 2004. Where TCAD is the governmental entity responsible for appraising and assessing the value of all real and personal property in Travis County. Overall, the total size of these files are under 600MB uncompressed. The colleague would like to analyze these databases for his research, so the goal for this project is to gather the information and present the deliverable that would help in the research in the form that the faculty colleague can access it in a format that preferably in an excel sheet for all data. This project is a prototypical combo of archives, databases/data engineering, and some knowledge on geographic information system work.

From the given annotated microfiche, it labeled all the tasks with an example of the following information: Parcel, lots size, use, sq ft , effect date built, deed date, land appraised value, improvement appraised value, owner name, mailing address, location, and Legal description. The final outcome to the faculty colleague will present a table in excel sheet that specifically extracts the data of these columns.

## Data

There are a total of two sets of folders that are given, the folder is named Appraisal_Roll_History_1990_A and Appraisal_Roll_History_B. Interestingly, these two folders contain the exact same files and in all files it has exactly the same information. This can be shown by running a python code that compare the folder:

```{python}
import os

folder_A = 'data/Appraisal_Roll_History_1990_A'
folder_B = 'data/Appraisal_Roll_History_1990_B'

for filename in os.listdir(folder_A):
    file_A = os.path.join(folder_A, filename)
    file_B = os.path.join(folder_B, filename)

    with open(file_A, "r") as a, open(file_B, "r") as b:
        data_A = a.read()
        data_B = b.read()

    if data_A == data_B:
        print(f"{filename}: Files are identical.")
    else:
        print(f"{filename}: Files are different.")
```

Within the folders, it contains 3 types of files:

-   IDX files: CREATE INDEX statements

-   TDF files: CREATE TABLE statements

-   Text files (TXT): data/ records

There are 2 general types of files, one is TCBC and the other is TXBC. From many searches, I assumed that TCBC is the abbreviation for Travis County Basic Code, and TXBC is the Travis County Extra-territory Basic Code. Where in these two general files there are some with suffixes followed:

-   CFOR (CFOR code)

-   GRANT_EXMP (grant exemption)

-   JURIS (jurisdiction): Each jurisdiction has its own tax rate, which is used to calculate the property taxes owed on a particular property within that jurisdiction. The JURIS code is used by the appraisal district to identify the specific jurisdiction for each property within its jurisdictional area.

-   JURIS_EXMP (jurisdiction exemption)

-   LEGAL (legal description): Typically used to identify and define the property for legal and taxation purposes, and it may include information such as the property's lot number, block number, subdivision name, survey name, and other identifying details. It's used to accurately identify and assess the value of a property for taxation purposes.

-   SUSP (suspended): When a property's value or other information is in the dispute or has not been fully determined. The SUSP code is used by the appraisal district to indicate that the assessment of a particular property is currently suspended or on hold for some reason.

-   SUSP_INIT (suspended initial): The SUSP_INIT code is used by the appraisal district to indicate that the initial assessment of a particular property has been suspended.

However, by looking at the file description, noticing that the data only provided are TCBC_SUM_1990, TCBC_SUM_1990_JURIS, TCBC_SUM_1990_LEGAL,TXBC_SUM_1990, TXBC_SUM_1990_JURIS, TXBC_SUM_1990_JURIS_EXMP, TXBC_SUM_1990_LEGAL.

## Method and Tools

To accomplish the tasks in this project, we have used Google Sheets to save our findings and list out the notes that can be shared within the teams. To unzip and read the files given, we used Python from JupyterHub under the EduPod server, and within imported the extension called DuckDB for running the SQL code in the Jupyter notebook.

## Findings

The deliverable from the annotated microfiche are mostly found in the TXBC (Travis County Extra-territory Basic Code) files. However, the client is not looking for the extra-territory records. This makes some confusion whether or not the TXBC represents the Travis County Extra-territory Basic Code. If not, what is the difference between TXBC and TCBC?

Looking at the parcel number on the microfiche (Image 1), the sample is having the format of XX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX. And from the data in TXBC_SUM_1990, the 'Parcel' column is presented as a 10-digits number and 'OwnrId' is a 4-digits number. It can be figured out that the parcel number from the microfiche is actually split up into 'Parcel' and 'OwnrId' columns of TXBC, where the first 10-digits is 'Parcel' and the last 4-digits is 'OwnrId'. Therefore, the unique key for the TXBC files is the combination of 'Parcel' and 'OwnrId'.

Unfortunately, we have not yet discovered the accurate data for the lot size. The sample lot size from microfiche (Image 2) is 62.5000X101.5000.

Throughout all data, we only found one column that contains "sqft" in the column labels. Therefore, we assume 'TotSqft' from the TXBC_SUM_1990 file is the reasonable data for sq ft in the microfiche. The reason we have to assume the 'TotSqft' as the matching information in the microfiche, is because the outcomes are widely spreaded from 4 to 2614058 other than the 0. Although there is also 'TotSqft' in the TCBC_SUM_1990 file, the only outcome is '0', which is not useful at all.

Use code is a 2-digits number code in the TXBC_SUM_1990 file, it should be matching with other information, but the description of this code was not provided in the datasets given. Luckily, I was able to find a document published for the Reappraisal Plan for Tax Years 2015-2016 by the Texas Comptroller of Public Account. Page 59 of this document (Image 9), it recorded the Use Codes with its description that was organized by the type of use, which we are taking this information and form it into tables so we can connect between tables. However, the data contains a pretty decent amount of records '00' and 'None' that couldn't be identified.

From the same document by the Texas Comptroller of Public Account, it provides the description of EYOC, which is the "year built and the effective year of construction" ( ), and this information is in the TXBC_SUM_1990 file. This matches with one of our deliverables of effect date built on the microfiche. However, I believe that there's some error with the data that was given to us from the TCAD, that there is a possible outcome with the year of 2971 and 0984. And in the data of EYOC, there is also having both None and 0000 and they are probably presenting the same meaning that they do not have the data for some records.

Any deed information can only be found in the TXBC_SUM_1990 file. The deed volume and page number only have one outcome throughout, for both all presented with "00000". And the deed date only has one record of "1900-00-00". The reason resulting in this information is possibly due to different system collection of appraisal in 1900 and exportation in 2004.

Part of the important deliverable are the land appraised value and the improvement appraised value, and this information can only be found in the TXBC_SUM_1990_JURIS file. Some interesting information is the value of 'LandMktVal' seems to match with 'LandApprdVal', and 'ImprMktVal' matches with the 'ImprApprdVal'. And the total appraised value ('TotApprdVal') is the sum of land appraised value and improvement appraised value, which can be found in the TXBC_SUM_1990_JURIS file.
